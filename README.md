## Project Overview

### Introduction
- **WIU synopsis**: Demonstrating competencies in text and social analytics through analyzing textual data like customer feedback and social media conversations.
- **Learning Outcomes**: Includes collecting and analyzing data ethically, performing text processing operations, and collaborating in developing data stories.

Our project aims to utilize multi-label classification to predict job roles like Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Software Engineer, and Business Analyst from job description texts. We will initially focus on single-label classification and proceed to multi-label if time permits. The goal is to aid job seekers in finding suitable employment opportunities by analyzing qualifications sought by employers. We will collect data from four recruitment websites: JobStreet, Indeed, Glassdoor, and LinkedIn, allowing us to recommend ideal jobs based on candidates' skills and qualifications.

### Business Objective

Our recommendation engine employs algorithms to suggest content to users based on their skill sets and qualifications. By analyzing data about the user behaviors, such as their abilities and expertise, the recommendation engine can provide personalized recommendations that are tailored to the userâ€™s skill sets and qualifications.

## Project Scope & Scenario

### Background & Scope
- Focuses on analyzing unstructured text data from sources like social media, emails, and documents to uncover insights for business decision-making.
- **Project Requirements**: Teams propose a project, collect data using web scraping, clean the data, build text classification models, and present findings.

### Our Scenario
In recent years, the advancement of job seeking online creates opportunities for many employees to obtain useful and meaningful information for their jobs, and hence recruiters search for suitable candidates by advertising job description and qualifications for each job role. Nevertheless, with extensive information of job descriptions and qualifications, it is mandatory to classify such information into certain job roles. Not only does it allow employees to readily look for the most ideal job, but also suggest appropriate roles for employees. Therefore, our team proposed a classification algorithm (machine learning) to predict job roles based on the job seeker skills and qualification.

The machine learning (ML) task of predicting suitable roles from job descriptions is Text Classification. This ML algorithm receives the input as a post of job qualifications, then predicts the suitable roles for job qualifications as the outcome. To implement this task, we firstly scraped the data about job descriptions and job requirements from various online job finding websites in Singapore. After gathering the dataset, we incorporated the ML models for multi-label text classification on the dataset to make 

## Key Tasks

1. **Project Proposal**: Identify a business problem, plan the project, and specify techniques and libraries to be used.
2. **Collect Text Data**: Scrape data from the internet, store it in CSV format, and annotate data if needed.
3. **Data Cleansing**: Apply text pre-processing techniques to clean the data for modeling.
4. **Text Classification Modeling**: Build and train multiple models, assess and compare them to identify the best outcome.
5. **Project Demonstration and Interview**: Evaluate the final model, demonstrate the project, and complete a mock job interview highlighting skills.

## Roles & Responsibilities

- **Module Tutor**: Provide feedback and advice to project teams.
- **Group Leader**: Manage project schedule, coordinate tasks, and communicate with the tutor. (Me)
- **Group Members**: Carry out assigned tasks, attend meetings, and cooperate with the team.

## Project Schedule & Submission

- The project will follow the CRISP-DM methodology over 8 weeks.
- Weekly tasks include defining the business problem, data understanding, preparation, modeling, evaluation, and final demonstration with a mock job interview.
